== Description ==
This Plugin automatically insert Highslide Script to your Blog without the need of any further configuration
or Shorttags or editing of old posts. As soon the Plugin is activated all existing thumped images using Highslide
to expand. But this isn`t all, the Plugin offers several Options to configure the look and behaviour of Highslide
in your Blog. For Advanced users there is also the option to specify own HS Parameters at the Option page.

Still that`s not all. Some other plugins dealing very dirty with the code of your blog.
Highslide 4 Wordpress *reloaded* is tested and optimized for Pagespeed also it offers a function to use the global
Coral CDN for CSS / JS delivery which, in many circumstances, save you bandwidth and improves page load speed.

As a new Feature, compared to existing Highslide Addons, you have the possibility to use HTML as a Highslide Popup
from within your Articles / Posts. For Example: If you put [highslide]This is a test[/highslide] somewhere in your
text wordpress just renders a link. If somebody click the link a highslide Windows expands showing "This is a test"
You are free to use HTML Tags / Formating inside the tag. Also you can specify a caption and a Linkname; Syntax:
[highslide](Caption;Link Name)Text to display[/highslide] for Example copy and Paste this one into a blogpost:
[highslide](This is the Caption;MyLink)I'm a interesting text, you can also format me or insert pictures.
Feel free to try.[/highslide]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Something like; I put on a detailed page on my website with some detailed information
and a kind of manual / instructions. http://solariz.de/highslide-wordpress-reloaded

= I have a problem or suggestion =
You can find a small Forum related to my Plugins at http://solariz.de feel free to ask.

= Is a commecial use possible ? =
Yes but the Original Highslide Script requires you to buy a official license,
it`s not expensive but this should be mentioned. On my Side I don`t request
money but if you want to use any of my scripts in a commercial way or on a
commecial webpage please check out my amazon wishlist there are several things
from cheap to expensive.   http://solariz.de/donate
